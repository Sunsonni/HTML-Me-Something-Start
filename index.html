               <p>
              
               <br>
               First, you need to absolutely have the Sweet and Sour Pork.
               <br>
               At first, I was thrown off by how crispy it was the first time I got it, but now I get it all the time! 
               It's a staple and always hits when you want something sweet and savory. Get some bok choy as a side and go to town.
               <br><br><br>
               Second recommendation from Cate zone is the Cumin Lamb.
               <br>
               Now this will not be everyone's cup of tea. 
               Lamb is a gamey meat but the spices in the lamb couteract it in a way that makes it a spicy and mouthwatering dish!

               <p>
                  Second on our list, Pearl Cafe.
               <br>
               Pearl Cafe is the best place to get Thai Food in STL!
               <br>
               If you've ever been to a STL food truck event, Pearl Cafe is actually the brick and mortar restaurant behind the famous TukTuk Thai!
               </p>
               <div class="row">
               <div class="column">
                  If you want your life to be changed for the better, get the Thai Ribs.
                  <br>
                  The ribs have that slight smoky flavor that comes from grilling it and I don't know what's in the rub or the sauce on top but it's addicting.
                  <br>
                  I went with a co-worker once who said that they didn't eat meat like that and they were gnawing on the bone at the end of it.
                  <br><br><br>
                  Second recommendation! You can never go wrong with a curry at a Thai place.
                  <br>
                  I personally like to get the red curry. The creaminess from the coconut milk perfectly mixes with the curry and complements whatever protein you chose. Delicious.

               Now I know that not everyone is a mushroom lover but the mushroom burrata is absolutely delicious and I occasionally find myself thinking about it.
               Burrata is a cheese I would describe to be akin to a mozzarella ball with fresh curd inside that kind of tastes like butter. 
               <br>
               Seasonally, they make the Mushroom burrata with Morels or Chantelles.
               <br><br><br>
               Second recommendation!

               I'm still trying to find my favorite entree at Katie's&hellip; But the Spaghetti and Meatballs will always hit.

            Last but certainly not least is Tiger Soup Dumpling.

               The best dumplings to get are the chicken ones. The broth has this subtle sweetness that coats your tongue. 
               I prefer to get the pan fried dumplings as it adds a little crisp to them.
               <br><br><br>
               As an additional side, get either the smash cucumbers or golden broccoli to the mix.
               They usually come way before the dumplings and are a good snack before getting to the actual meal.
